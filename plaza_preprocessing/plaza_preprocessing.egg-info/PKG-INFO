Description: # Plaza Preprocessing
        
        This is the plaza preprocessing package for [plazaroute](https://github.com/PlazaRoute/plazaroute), responsible for preparing OSM files for optimized pedestrian routing with support for routing through plazas.
        
        ## Install
        
        See [the Docker readme](docker/) for quickly getting up and running without an installation.
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/PlazaRoute/plazaroute.git
        $ cd plazaroute
        $ pip install plaza_preprocessing/
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Download an OSM file
        
        plaza_preprocessing takes an existing OSM file as an input. Data for Switzerland can be found on https://planet.osm.ch.
        
        #### Updating OSM file
        
        In order to keep the OSM data up to date without redownloading it every time, you can use [pyosmium-up-to-date](http://docs.osmcode.org/pyosmium/latest/tools_uptodate.html) provided by pyosmium. Example to bring [switzerland-padded.osm.pbf](https://planet.osm.ch) up to date:
        
        ```
        pyosmium-up-to-date -v --server https://planet.osm.ch/replication/hour/ switzerland-padded.osm.pbf
        ```
        
        You can also do this with Docker without having to install pyosmium. See the [the Docker readme](docker/) for reference.
        
        ## Preprocessing
        
        ```
        usage: plaza_preprocessing [-h] [--config filename] [-v] source destination
        
        Preprocess an OSM file for pedestrian routing over plazas.
        
        positional arguments:
          source             input OSM file to process
          destination        destination OSM file
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help         show this help message and exit
          --config filename  specify a config file location. A default config will be
                             created if the path does not exist
          -v                 verbose log output
        ```
        
        Example:
        
        ```
        plaza_preprocessing switzerland-padded.osm.pbf switzerland-processed.osm.pbf
        ```
